#i'm actually building a band name generator where i prompt a user to input the name of their city and the name of their pet, and i'll use this informatiion to generate a band name for them.

city_name = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in? ")
pet_name = input("What's your pet's name? ")

print("Your band name could be " + city_name + pet_name)
